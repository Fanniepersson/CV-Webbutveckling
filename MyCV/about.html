                <h3>Fannie Persson</h3>
                <h4>.NET Developer to be</h4>
                <p>My name is Fannie and I live in Sweden, Halmstad. I am a .NET Developer student
                 at Campus Varberg. My dream is to work in the tech industry and have my own company in the future.
                </p>
                <p>I have earlier in my life been working with many different types of jobs, for three years I was working at a warehouse in Ängelholm, and later
                   I worked at a warehouse in Gothenburg for almost a year. After that I worked a couple months as a Hotel receptionist at a hotel in Gothenburg, 
                   and as a barista at a café in Kungsbacka before I moved to Halmstad during the summer of 2020. In Halmstad I worked half a year for a company called HMS Network.
                </p>  
                <p class="text">I have always known that I wanted to do something else in my life and I was curious about programming.
                    So last year I made the decision that I should start studying to be a .NET Developer,  
                    and I am so glad that I made the right decision, it´s so much fun and it feels really great!</p>
